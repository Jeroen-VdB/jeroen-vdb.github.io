Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?    
My name is, chka-chka, Jeroen.

I'm a passionate Azure Application Developer and Architect with several years of experience crafting innovative cloud solutions, specializing in Azure Integration Services. Currently, I'm delving into the exciting realm of Azure OpenAI and Semantic Kernel.

As of 2024, I've transitioned to freelancing, granting me the flexibility to manage my workweek efficiently. I allocate dedicated hours to explore new and innovative technologies, a pursuit I'm eager to share through my blog.
